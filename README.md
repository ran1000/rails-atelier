<h1> Rantelier </h1>


Rantelier was conceived as an app for collecting moments, projects, ideas, thoughts and curated fragments of life. The idea of a never ending work-in-progress space, where things cross by and meet up.

<h3> Features </h3>

A blog with a dynamic masonry-style index was implemented, comparing different approaches and JS packages.

This project is currently discontinued.
